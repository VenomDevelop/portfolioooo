            <h1>Client Report <a class="report-website" href="https://venomdevelop.github.io/wdd130-project-mckin/index.html" target="_blank">My website</a></h1> 
            <h2>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h2>
            <p>I made some basic graphics om my own as my website lacked many images.</p>
            <h2>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</h2>
            <p>I comunicated with my developers using email. The only issue was response time.</p>
            <h2>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h2>
            <p>As of December 8th, 2025 they have not. This is because the website isn't finished.</p>
            <h2>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h2>
            <p>I would give them a better wireframe, more info, and images.</p>

            <h1>Lead Report <a class="report-website" href="https://tee-cox.github.io/wdd130-project-cox/" target="_blank">Website I lead</a></h1>
            <h2>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?</h2>
            <p>I used email.</p>
            <h2>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</h2>
            <p>I also used email. The only issue was response time.</p>
            <h2>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</h2>
            <p>I left notes in my pull requests for the client to view.</p>
            <h2>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</h2>
            <p>Good mostly. I've used GitHub since 2019 so I feel somewhat used to its layout.</p>

            <h2>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</h2>
            <p>I used email. The only issue was response time.</p>
            <h2>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</h2>
            <p>I did for one, but the other was confusing as the clients wireframe was not clear.</p>
            <h2>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</h2>
            <p>Yes.</p>
            <h2>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</h2>
            <p>Yes. I was unable to pull my changes to the main branch, but I resolved this with you in class.</p>

        <section class="report">
            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <h2>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</h2>
            <p>General project confusion. This was resolved by communication, but comunication also took time.</p>
            <h2>What did you enjoy most about this project?</h2>
            <p>Finishing my pages. I am proud of the pages I made for FitStart and Sole Swap.</p>
            <h2>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</h2>
            <p>I would have made it a requirement to set up a Microsoft teams group chat for comunication.</p>
            <h2>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</h2>
            <p>Yes, after doing this project I feel more confident in working on projects simular to it. Being in four teams at once was difficult at first, but I eventualy figured out organize myself to get things done effectively.</p>
